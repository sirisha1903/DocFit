Solving a Real-World Problem

Students applying for competitive exams like GATE, JEE, NEET, UPSC, BITSAT, and CAT often face issues with document uploads. Each exam has strict requirements for:
âœ… Passport-size photos (specific dimensions & file sizes)
âœ… Signatures (fixed resolutions)
âœ… Aadhaar card scans (clear formatting)

Many struggle with manual resizing, leading to rejections and last-minute stress.
